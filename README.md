This repository describes how the ontology mapping from ICD-9 to ICD-10 is conducted.

## Mapping method 1
We scrapped an online mapping tools [crosswalk]((http://www.icd10codesearch.com/)) and converted ICD9 - 10 mapping by running condition_ranking.py and results with the rankings of mapped ICD-10 codes and ICD category were saved as mapped_condition_count.csv and hierarchy_condition_count.csv
```python
python condition_ranking.py
```
## Mapping method 2


## drug_disease relationship validation
## Binomial test
## mortality prediction model
